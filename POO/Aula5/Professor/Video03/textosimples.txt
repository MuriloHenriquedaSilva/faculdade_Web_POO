The basic idea is that you keep everything - and I mean
everything - in one big text file. My text file contains lists
of things to do, reference material (phone numbers, 
people's birthdays, summaries of books that I've found 
informative), notes from all the meetings that I attend and 
work-in-progress (blog entries, wiki pages, documents, and 
particularly long or complex emails).
My text file is now coming up on ten thousand lines in size. 
This sounds large and unmanageable but it is still little more 
than 300K in size - much smaller than the average PowerPoint 
presentation file we routinely send round attached to emails. 
And any modern, good quality text editor - a Vi or EMACS for 
example - is able to handle files much, much bigger than this 
without any loss of performance. At some point I will have to 
move some of the stuff into some kind of separate archival 
file. However I don't yet feel anywhere close to that point 
just yet. I definitely feel that the file could grow by at 
least another order of magnitude before I'd have to consider 
doing this (which should mean that it's at least five years 
before I have to do anything).
